* Make a room-generator script that takes plain English input and spits out room objects or classes.

* Clean up the code a bit

* Write a scanner that will understand user input and call the appropriate methods.
Let it return tokens and an associated value. Something like (direction, north)

* Write a 'death' method that will be invoked by a health checker method.
Include health checker in the main program so that it will loop after every input.
Perhaps something more efficient would do too...

* Add in fights with dragons and what not :')
